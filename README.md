# MLVoidChest

**MLVoidChest** is a Minecraft plugin for version **1.21.4** that adds an **automatic selling system** using a special Voidchest.

## üì¶ Features

- Automatically sells **all items on the ground** in the **same chunk** as the Voidchest every **15 seconds**.
- Also sells **items inside the Voidchest inventory**.
- Only sells items that are **configured for sale** in **ShopGUIPlus**.
- Displays a **hologram** above the Voidchest using **DecentHolograms**.
- Works seamlessly with **item stacking** using **WildStacker**.

## üõ† Requirements

This plugin depends on the following plugins to function properly:

- [Vault](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/vault.34315/)
